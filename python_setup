* Enable use of basic Python on Macbook
  * Installed Python3 (3.12.4)
    * Downloaded the installer from Apple's website
  * After installing, required install of Command Line Tools for Mac
    * Installing Xcode (Apple's IDE) was NOT required - I decided to delay deciding what IDE to use
    * Installing the most recent version of Command Line Tools failed because my OS was outdated (MacOS 12.7)
      * Used GPT to determine last full version of Command Line Tools compatible: XCode 14.2
        * Source: https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=command%20line%20tools%20XCode%2014.2
